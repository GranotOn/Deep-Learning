# Logistic Regression with TensorFlow

- **Recall Linear Regression with TensorFlow before starting**

## What is different between Linear and Logistic Regression?
While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g estimating house price), it is not the best tool for predicting the class in which an observed data point belongs.  
In order to provide estimate for classification, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the most probable class for that data point. For this, we use Logistic Regression.
