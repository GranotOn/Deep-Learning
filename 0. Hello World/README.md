# Hello World

As a start we will create a simple program to add 2 constants using TensorFlow.

Even this simple example of adding 2 constants to reach a simple result, defines the basis of TensorFlow.

## What is the meaning of Tensor?

In TensorFlow all data is passed between operations in a computation graph, and these are passed in the form of Tensors, hence the name of TensorFlow.

The word tensor from new latin means "that which stretches". It is a mathematical object that is named "tensor" because an early application of tensors was the study of materials stretching under tension. The contemporary meaning of tensors can be taken as multidimensional arrays.

- The zero dimension can be seen as a point, or a single object.
- The first dimension can be seen as a line, and expressed using a single-dimensional array. (see a bellow)
- The second dimension can be seen as a surface, and imagined using a matrix. (see b bellow)
- The third dimension can be seen as a volume, a three-dimensional array can be seen as an infinite series of surfaces along an infinite line. (see c bellow)

And so on..
